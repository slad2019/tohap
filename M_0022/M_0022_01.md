**Q:**  Tell me how old were you when you first became a monk? And how old are you now?   

**A:**  At age 6. Now I'm 70. (Born in 1921).   

**Q:**  Where were you born?   

**A:**  I was born in Phembo Langthang [Tib. འཕན་པོ་གླང་ཐང].   

**Q:**  How did you become a monk? Did your parents take you to the monastery?   

**A:**  My mother's brother told my mother that I should become a monk and he took me to the monastery.   

**Q:**  Were there other <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག]** 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher.

The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> at this time?   

**A:**  There were 4 in our shag. Just before I got separated from my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན]** 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag).

**Q:**  You were in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས]** One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> Tratsang, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Which <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན]** A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>?   

**Q:**  Hamdong Khamtsen.   

**Q:**  Were your gegens <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ]** A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum.

**A:**  They were all <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས]** An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> lharamba, the best ones. They were good in pecha.   

**Q:**  When you became a monk did you know how to read letters?

**Q:**  Who taught you?   

**A:**  My <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན]** 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> taught me to read.   

**Q:**  For how many years did you learn the letters and the basic prayers [Tib. ཁ་འདོན]?   

**A:**  I studied <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ]** Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a> until I was 17 years old. Then at age 18, I was to start studying tsenyi. But I didn't understand it well so I learned to play the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དུང་རྒྱ་གླིང]** The large trumpet-horn and the clarinet-type wind instrument both of which are played by monks specializing in instruments in the monastery.">dung gyaling</a>, which was done by the monks who didn't know pecha well.   

**Q:**  Is playing <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང]** A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a> regarded as <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ]** The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a>?   

**A:**  It is a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ]** The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a> for those young monks who do not study pecha. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ]** Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> would ask "Do you want to study trumpet or gyaling." You had your choice and I choose the gyaling.   

**Q:**  Did you start playing the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང]** A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a> at age 18?   

**A:**  Yes. I continued playing <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང]** A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a> for 12 years (from age 18 or from 1939). Then after this I served as the gyaling gegen for 12 more years. I learned the gyaling completely, that's why I can still play it.   

**Q:**  How did you subsist when you were young?   

**A:**  When I stayed with my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན]** 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a>, from home, they sent a little bit of tsampa.   

**Q:**  Was your household rich?   

**A:**  My household wasn't rich, but my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན]** 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a>'s household was well off and they sent tsamba. There was also 6 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ]** A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain salary (Tib. དྲུཕོག [འབྲུ་ཕོགས]) from the tratsang. From the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ]** The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a>, we got 2 junbo of grain, which had about 15 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བྲེ]** A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</a> in one junbo. Like this we managed to subsist.   

**Q:**  What was your study program for learning the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང]** A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a>?   

**A:**  When the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན]** 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> taught us the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང]** A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a>, he taught us chapter by chapter [Tib. ལེའུ]. Then, in between, there was one called banda [Tib. བར་བརྡ] and gobjang [Tib. འགོ་བྱང] which he taught us in between the chapters. There were 4 or 7 different chapters. These are what you play at the start and in between. In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས]** One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> there are 14 different fingerings for the gyaling. And there are also some fingerings that came from outside. When you become good at the gyaling you can tell what fingering the another person is doing just from listening to him playing.   

**Q:**  Are there any notes for playing the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང]** A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a>?   

**A:**  No, not for the gyaling. For the trumpet there is a note called thungtsig [Tib. དུང་ཚིག] but not for gyaling.   

**Q:**  When you started learning the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང]** A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a>, would the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ]** Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> tell you to learn the gyaling or the trumpet?   

**Q:**  It was our choice what to learn. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ]** Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> would not tell us to learn this and that. The term to graduate learning the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང]** A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a> was 12 years. After 12 years when the old ones graduate, we went to the khembo and asked him to install a new class of gyaling players. Each year when we had to go take the test, the khembo would asked us whether we wanted to learn the gyaling or the trumpet. Then we would tell him whatever we wanted to learn. Then we would carry our bedding, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ]** The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</a>, pots and fuel, and for 3 months we stayed under the big boulder and learned. There were 2 boulders. The trumpet players stayed by the west one and the gyaling players stayed by the eastern one.   

**Q:**  Did you have tents?   

**A:**  No, we slept under the boulders.   

**Q:**  For how many days did you stay there?   

**A:**  We stayed there for 3 months.   

**Q:**  Was it in the summer?   

**A:**  We did this in spring when the days are the longest. If we studied real hard for these three months we could learn.   

**Q:**  I heard that there were many ways of learning, like keeping a thorn under your armpit?   

**A:**  Yes, there were. At first when we learned the fingerings, we used a wooden stick with holes made on it like those on a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང]** A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a>. And then we practiced the fingerings while humming the tunes with our elbows outstretched. We had to look directly in front, neither up or down. I heard that they used to put a small bag of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ]** The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> on [the] front of the stick to build up strength, but we didn't have to do this. If you learned like this, the ones who hummed the tunes well would be able to learn the gyaling well and play it with a pleasant sound.   

**Q:**  How many students were there with you in your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང]** A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a> class?   

**A:**  About 30 or so. The same number in the trumpet class. Usually when you are a musician, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང]** A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> won't ask you to do any other work except occasionally.   

**Q:**  Would you put a thorn under your armpit?   

**A:**  In our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང]** A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> we didn't put thorns under our armpits. I heard of this, but we didn't do this. Maybe Drepung Ngagpa [Tib. སྔགས་པ] was doing that.   

**Q:**  What happened after your 3 month training period?   

**A:**  Then you had to take a test before the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ]** Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་སྣེ]** The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</a> of the tratsang. There were two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང]** A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a> <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན]** 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a>. The gegen would tell the lene that we were doing this fingering or that fingering and we would have to play it. In 1 year there are 12 months, so we took off one boot strap and by lottery we picked which two monks would be on duty each month. Two were needed every month. The two who were picked would be on duty. This month you are on and have to go play in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས]** 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> or wherever. If you get the 5th or 10th lunar month, there is a lot of work, so you often have to hire players to fill in for you in one place while you are at another place.   

**Q:**  Do you have many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང]** A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a> instruments?   

**A:**  In the past, we had many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང]** A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a> instruments. There were about 14-15 pairs of the gyaling for practicing and there were many better quality gyaling. Now, among the present gyaling, one was bought from the market by Rinchen Könchog [Tib. རིན་ཆེན་དཀོན་ཅོག] and one was fixed up by me. We only have two. We made a new set of copper large trumpets which cost 3000 ¥.   

**Q:**  Were there extra shares of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕོགས]** 1. Salary (for a job). 2. The salary-like payments in grain, etc., that monk&#x27;s receive from their monastery.">phog</a> when you were a musician?   

**A:**  If you go outside the monastery, then you get some amount of fee [Tib. kuyön]. This is left with the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང]** A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a> "club" (Tib. ཇིཔ [སྤྱི་པ]) and this is called jisog [Tib. སྤྱི་གསོག] and is used for giving <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འགྱེ]** Alms given to monks.">gye</a>, etc. when you graduate. The outside people would give us food and some money and they would say it was for buying bread. In the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང]** A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, when we played the gyaling in the assembly hall, we got nothing because this is the place where you get your food.   

**Q:**  Who invites you from outside of the monastery.   

**A:**  There were many like Thamba Simkhang [Tib. དན་འབག་གཟིམ་ཁང], Tenmey Simkhang [Tib. བསྟན་མའི་གཟིམ་ཁང], and Gadong [Tib. དགའ་གདོང], and we had to go for 7 days each month to Norbulinga. Actually, our term is for 12 years, but if there are a lot of misc. young monks in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང]** A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, after 10 years we would ask the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ]** Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> to let us graduate, which is called thöngyag [Tib. ཐོན་རྒྱག] and start a new group. We would make a list of the dabedobe (youngsters) and show this to the khembo and say please give us some new ones. Rinchen Könchog was a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང]** A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a> player with us. After he did his test, they didn't send him to play because he left it.   

**Q:**  Did you give the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ]** A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> to become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲས་རམས་པ]** A type of lower rank geshe degree.">drerampa</a> in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས]** One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>?   

**A:**  Yes. My <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན]** 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk.

**Q:**  Do you call this part of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤམ་ཐབས་ཁྲལ]** The work obligation that monks have to do for their monastery.">shamtabtre</a>?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did you do any other work in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང]** A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>?   

**A:**  After I took the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང]** A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a> test, when I became little bit more senior, I was made to do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང]** A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a> job. Sometimes there were monks who asked for the chabril job and sometimes when no one asked, it was ordered from above.

**A:**  Yes, and I got an extra share of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འགྱེ]** Alms given to monks.">gye</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕོགས]** 1. Salary (for a job). 2. The salary-like payments in grain, etc., that monk&#x27;s receive from their monastery.">phog</a> from the tratsang.   

**Q:**  Was there an extra share of the grain salary?   

**A:**  Not a complete extra share, but we got 2 (Tib. ཇུནབོ [བཅུ་འབོ]) more (1 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ]** A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a>, starting from the morning?   

**A:**  First I had to beat the gong just after the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ]** The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a> to call the monks to the shogchö. Then I had to beat the gong again to call the monks to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ]** The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> and then oversee serving the 4 teas.

The young monks had to do this by turns, as a tax in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར]** The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> regularly. Then, when the umdze and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས]** The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> stood up in chöra and put on their <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཟླ་གམ]** The cloak monks wear at the prayer assembly sessions.">dagam</a> cloaks, I had to beat the gong again. Then in the evening there was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་རིམ]** A religious prayer service for monks.">kurim</a> prayer session and again I had to beat the gong to call the monks to attend the session. Then my work was done.

The jama would then send the tea or thukpa. I had to know how many servers to send in each row to finish it off. [Note: The grease was determined by how the tea was ladled from the cauldron in the kitchen. At first the grease was on the top and this was ladled into the chabdra and served to the senior monks first.]

**A:**  No. That was only done by the gegö.   

**Q:**  Did you have the right to beat the monks?   

**A:**  I was not allowed to beat the monks in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འདུ་ཁང]** An assembly hall in a monastery.">dukhang</a>. That was the prerogative of the gegö. And I also was not allowed to beat the monks in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རུང་ཁང]** A monastic kitchen.">rungkhang</a>. This was the right of the jama. My right was only in the space between the rungkhang and dukhang, but I didn't need to beat the monks much because <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས]** One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> didn't do much pushing like was the case in Gomang. Deyang was a small <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང]** A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, so there were none of those disgusting behaviors.   

**Q:**  You were in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ]** A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a>'s <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང]** 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  And you <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས]** One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> did a competition with Ngagpa [Tib. སྔགས་པ] College where the main item was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག]** A kind of monks&#x27; competitive &quot;sports&quot; event (mostly jumping and throwing) done by dobdo monks.">chogyag</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. I joined the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག]** A kind of monks&#x27; competitive &quot;sports&quot; event (mostly jumping and throwing) done by dobdo monks.">chogyag</a> at age 18. I can't blame my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན]** 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> because he would have been glad if I had learned pecha. But I changed my mind and I couldn't learn the pecha. So after I was 17 years old, then I became a dobdo.   

**Q:**  Didn't your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན]** 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> scold you?   

**A:**  I stayed separate from my gegen. Rinchen Könchog and I were the same. I stayed in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང]** 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a>. I did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག]** A kind of monks&#x27; competitive &quot;sports&quot; event (mostly jumping and throwing) done by dobdo monks.">chogyag</a> when I was 24 [1945] and Rinchen Könchog was 27 years of age. So I was in the tobtsang for 7 years and did the chogyag against Sera Ngagpa.   

**Q:**  You won the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག]** A kind of monks&#x27; competitive &quot;sports&quot; event (mostly jumping and throwing) done by dobdo monks.">chogyag</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Who was your leader [Tib. གེངོ]?   

**A:**  Our first <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒན་འགོ]** The head of the dobdo&#x27;s organization when they did &quot;sports&quot; competitions.">gengo</a> was Shang Atru [Tib. zhang ?]. Then we didn't get along well so we got a new gengo nicknamed Uncle Marmot (Tib. ཤང་ཆིབི [ཞང་འཕྱི་ཕི]). There were, however, other older <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ]** A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> who helped us. I think there was only 2 years between the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང]** One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>'s <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག]** A kind of monks&#x27; competitive &quot;sports&quot; event (mostly jumping and throwing) done by dobdo monks.">chogyag</a> and ours. How old are you now? I am 70. It must have been in 1945-46 when we did the chogyag. Did Gomang do the chogyag before you did it? It was about 2 years before us when they did it in Lemthang [Tib. ?]. After that you started a new <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང]** 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a>, right? Yes. I heard that the tobtsang after you, wasn't able to do the chogyag competition. A new tobtsang was started but they never did the chogyag. Before that, Gomang and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སེ་ར་སྨད]** The Mey (Me) College of Sera Monastery.">Sera Mey</a> went to compete in Phembo Degong [Tib. འཕན་པོ་སྡེ་གོང྄], but the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་སྣེ]** The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</a> stopped them. Rinchen Könchog's tobtsang, where he was the gengo, did the Lhagye Chogyag where there was no winner or loser because Ngagpa didn't dare to do the chogyag. Did they set up a tobtsang after this? Yes. One was started. But it wasn't able to compete as the revolt took place. After how many years did the lene stop the chogyag between the Gomang? I think it was just before the revolt. [He is wrong it was earlier]. When did <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང]** One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སེ་ར་བྱེས]** The Jey (Je) College of Sera Monastery.">Sera Jey</a> do the chogyag? Did they do it after you did? They did it before us at the place called Bontö [Tib. འབྲོམ་སྟོད]. And probably Gomang and Sera Mey did the Lemthang chogyag. After that, Loseling did the chogyag and later we got their tent. I had kind of a suspicion [Tib. རྣམ་རྟོག] because Loseling lost. Were there any chogyag after yours? No. Was the Gomang chogyag stopped because Sera Mey wouldn't come or was it stopped by the lene? It was stopped by the lene. I think the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕོ་བྲང་སྡེ་པ]** The monastic official in charge of the Ganden Photrang building in Drepung monastery.">phodrang depa</a> and some others went to inform them. Did the shengo go? No. Did the laji go? I'm not sure. What was the reason for <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས]** One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> and Ngagpa not competing? Was it caused by the lene? Ngagpa didn't dare to compete. The leader of the Ngagpa didn't tell them not to compete, right? Yes. They didn't dare to compete because Sera Ngagpa was almost entirely dobdo. Usually they looked down on Deyang like a food ready to eat [easy to defeat]. But when we did the chogyag, they lost. After this, they were afraid to lose again if they weren't careful. So they told us they couldn't compete right now, but [to] wait a few years. We said no, and we said that we were going to do the Lhagye Chogyag so we did the Lhagye Chogyag. We played all of the 12 male games [Tib. ཕོ་རྩལ་སྣེ་ཁ་བཅུ་གཉིས] though we lost on the first item. I heard that they would not listen to it even though they had signed the agreement and there was a guarantor. There was no fighting when you did the chogyag, right? In our chogyag, we didn't have trouble with fights except for when a small kid hit us with a stone. After that, we competitors left by coracles to Dechen [Tib. བདེ་ཆེན]. Did you do any jobs after doing the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ]** The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a>? Just before the revolt, I was supposed to go to Tö to the monastery called Tashi Chömpel [Tib. བཀྲ་ཤིས་ཆོས་འཕེལ] in Tingkye [Tib. གཏིང་སྐྱེས]. There were three of us going [4 including himself], one as <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ]** Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a>, myself as <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད]** A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> and 2 servants approved by the deity Thamba Shanggo. The servants had gone ahead of us, but then the revolt took place before we left. One of them ran away to India and the other died in prison. Was the khembo to be the khembo of that monastery? The khembo was sent from among the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད]** Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a> geshe.

Was this a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤམ་ཐབས་ཁྲལ]** The work obligation that monks have to do for their monastery.">shamtabtre</a> or one's wish. Not my own wish.

In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> when you did this? No. We had already been separated. What would you have to do if you become a chatsül? Did you have to give a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ]** A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a>?

Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> having the thickness of yogurt, and give whatever amount of gye. If one is capable, chatsül was a step on the road to being shengo. I wouldn't be able to do that because I didn't have the umey reading skills, though I could read <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དབུ་ཅན]** The style of Tibetan writing that is used in printing.

So I swear by the Buddha's Statue in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇོ་ཁང]** A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha. It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</a> that I didn't have a thought of becoming a shengo. But I could read uchen well. Did you have to do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང]** 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3.

After you do the nyertsang, then you will become the candidate for the shengo position. Was the nyertsang term three years? It probably was. After you separated from your gegen, how did you subsist?

The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> with that sick guy in the next room. I did a little bit of trade and their families in Phembo sent some <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ]** The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a>. We also got the grain salary. So there was no worry of livelihood in those days. What about your trade? I carried things on my back when I went to Tsöna. I went to Kalimpong 3 times. When I separated at age 18, I immediately went to Kalimpong on trade business. Where did you get your capital from? I borrowed it from the loan lenders. It was an interest loan with another monk acting as a guarantor. I went to Kalimpong to buy a load of tobacco and carried it back on my back. What did you take to Kalimpong? I took along with me a little less than one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ]** A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a> and ten sang, and I wrapped them in a woolen baby sock and hid them in the middle of my tsamba. I didn't have enough clothes to wear. Did you have a partner on the trip? On the trip to Kalimpong I had one. When coming back I was alone. I didn't have [proper] boots to wear. It is like recounting the poor people's suffering. I wore a pair of boots patched with a leather sole. I left on the 5th day of the 8th lunar month. At the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གམ་པ་ལ]** The mountain pass that separates Tsang and Central Tibet (Ü). It overlooks the Yarlung Tsangpo River and Chushul.">Gampala</a> mountain pass, my boots became worn out, so from then on I walked barefooted to Kalimpong. In the morning when I left I felt some pain in my feet, but after a while it became kind of numb. But when I reached the lodging inn I felt a burning sensation in my feet. [Trindor-- [not on the tape] when I was a kid most people went barefoot during summer and had hard soles on their feet. It hurt for a while but this soon disappeared.]

Did they do it after you did?   

**A:**  They did it before us at the place called Bontö [Tib. འབྲོམ་སྟོད]. And probably <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང]** One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སེ་ར་སྨད]** The Mey (Me) College of Sera Monastery.">Sera Mey</a> did the Lemthang <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག]** A kind of monks&#x27; competitive &quot;sports&quot; event (mostly jumping and throwing) done by dobdo monks.">chogyag</a>. After that, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང]** One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> did the chogyag and later we got their tent. I had kind of a suspicion [Tib. རྣམ་རྟོག] because Loseling lost.   

**Q:**  Were there any <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག]** A kind of monks&#x27; competitive &quot;sports&quot; event (mostly jumping and throwing) done by dobdo monks.">chogyag</a> after yours?   

**A:**  No.   

**Q:**  Was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང]** One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> chogyag stopped because <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སེ་ར་སྨད]** The Mey (Me) College of Sera Monastery.">Sera Mey</a> wouldn't come or was it stopped by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་སྣེ]** The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</a>?   

**A:**  It was stopped by the lene. I think the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕོ་བྲང་སྡེ་པ]** The monastic official in charge of the Ganden Photrang building in Drepung monastery.">phodrang depa</a> and some others went to inform them.   

**Q:**  Did the shengo go?   

**A:**  No.   

**Q:**  Did the laji go?   

**A:**  I'm not sure.   

**Q:**  What was the reason for <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས]** One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> and Ngagpa not competing? Was it caused by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་སྣེ]** The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</a>?   

**A:**  Ngagpa didn't dare to compete.   

**Q:**  The leader of the Ngagpa didn't tell them not to compete, right?   

**A:**  Yes. They didn't dare to compete because Sera Ngagpa was almost entirely dobdo. Usually they looked down on <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས]** One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> like a food ready to eat [easy to defeat]. But when we did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག]** A kind of monks&#x27; competitive &quot;sports&quot; event (mostly jumping and throwing) done by dobdo monks.">chogyag</a>, they lost. After this, they were afraid to lose again if they weren't careful. So they told us they couldn't compete right now, but [to] wait a few years. We said no, and we said that we were going to do the Lhagye Chogyag so we did the Lhagye Chogyag. We played all of the 12 male games [Tib. ཕོ་རྩལ་སྣེ་ཁ་བཅུ་གཉིས] though we lost on the first item. I heard that they would not listen to it even though they had signed the agreement and there was a guarantor.   

**Q:**  There was no fighting when you did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག]** A kind of monks&#x27; competitive &quot;sports&quot; event (mostly jumping and throwing) done by dobdo monks.">chogyag</a>, right?   

**A:**  In our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག]** A kind of monks&#x27; competitive &quot;sports&quot; event (mostly jumping and throwing) done by dobdo monks.">chogyag</a>, we didn't have trouble with fights except for when a small kid hit us with a stone. After that, we competitors left by coracles to Dechen [Tib. བདེ་ཆེན].   

**Q:**  Did you do any jobs after doing the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ]** The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a>?   

**A:**  Just before the revolt, I was supposed to go to Tö to the monastery called Tashi Chömpel [Tib. བཀྲ་ཤིས་ཆོས་འཕེལ] in Tingkye [Tib. གཏིང་སྐྱེས]. There were three of us going [4 including himself], one as <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ]** Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a>, myself as <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད]** A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> and 2 servants approved by the deity Thamba Shanggo. The servants had gone ahead of us, but then the revolt took place before we left. One of them ran away to India and the other died in prison.   

**Q:**  Was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ]** Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> to be the khembo of that monastery?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ]** Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> was sent from among the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད]** Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a> geshe.   

**Q:**  Was the monastery in Tö a big one?

**Q:**  Was this a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤམ་ཐབས་ཁྲལ]** The work obligation that monks have to do for their monastery.">shamtabtre</a> or one's wish.   

**A:**  Not my own wish. It was the deity again who selected me and the khembo.   

**Q:**  Were you in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས]** One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> tsondu?   

**A:**  No. I didn't do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས]** The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>. I did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བྱ་ཚུལ]** A monastic higher status that was secured by a monk serving 3 teas and 1 thukpa having the thickness of yogurt to the monastic assembly together with giving whatever amount of gye one could afford. It was considered a stepping-stone to securing higher positions and also exempted the monk from certain work obligations.">chatsül</a> so I didn't have to do gegö. My reading wasn't good, so if I became a gegö, I would have to read the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐྱབས་ཐོ]** A letter that includes a donation and a request for a specific prayer to be read at the start of the monk&#x27;s joint prayer chanting in the Mönlam or monastic prayer assemblies.">gyabtho</a> written in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དབུ་མེད]** The style of &quot;headless&quot; Tibetan writing that is intermediate between printed style and cursive.">umey</a> and I would have trouble reading it, so I did the chatsül to avoid it.   

**Q:**  Were you with your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན]** 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> when you did this?   

**A:**  No. We had already been separated.   

**Q:**  What would you have to do if you become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བྱ་ཚུལ]** A monastic higher status that was secured by a monk serving 3 teas and 1 thukpa having the thickness of yogurt to the monastic assembly together with giving whatever amount of gye one could afford.

A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> having the thickness of yogurt, and give whatever amount of gye. If one is capable, chatsül was a step on the road to being shengo. I wouldn't be able to do that because I didn't have the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དབུ་མེད]** The style of &quot;headless&quot; Tibetan writing that is intermediate between printed style and cursive.">umey</a> reading skills, though I could read <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དབུ་ཅན]** The style of Tibetan writing that is used in printing. The equivalent of block letters.">uchen</a> well. So I swear by the Buddha's Statue in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇོ་ཁང]** A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha. It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</a> that I didn't have a thought of becoming a shengo. But I could read uchen well.

**A:**  I didn't get the turn for doing the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང]** 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>. After you do the nyertsang, then you will become the candidate for the shengo position.

**A:**  It probably was.   

**Q:**  After you separated from your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན]** 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a>, how did you subsist?   

**A:**  I joined the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག]** 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> with that sick guy in the next room. I did a little bit of trade and their families in Phembo sent some tsamba. We also got the grain salary. So there was no worry of livelihood in those days.   

**Q:**  What about your trade?   

**A:**  I carried things on my back when I went to Tsöna. I went to Kalimpong 3 times. When I separated at age 18, I immediately went to Kalimpong on trade business.   

**Q:**  Where did you get your capital from?   

**A:**  I borrowed it from the loan lenders. It was an interest loan with another monk acting as a guarantor. I went to Kalimpong to buy a load of tobacco and carried it back on my back.   

**Q:**  What did you take to Kalimpong?   

**A:**  I took along with me a little less than one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ]** A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ]** The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a>. I had a relative in Tölung and I went to do the harvest with him. But I didn't know how to harvest well so I said I wasn't staying there since I couldn't do it. So my relative gave me a little less than a khe of tsamba and I returned to the monastery. I borrowed 6 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད]** A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a>, which was in coins of three <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང]** A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a> and ten sang, and I wrapped them in a woolen baby sock and hid them in the middle of my tsamba. I didn't have enough clothes to wear.   

**Q:**  Did you have a partner on the trip?   

**A:**  On the trip to Kalimpong I had one. When coming back I was alone. I didn't have [proper] boots to wear. It is like recounting the poor people's suffering. I wore a pair of boots patched with a leather sole. I left on the 5th day of the 8th lunar month. At the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གམ་པ་ལ]** The mountain pass that separates Tsang and Central Tibet (Ü). It overlooks the Yarlung Tsangpo River and Chushul.">Gampala</a> mountain pass, my boots became worn out, so from then on I walked barefooted to Kalimpong. In the morning when I left I felt some pain in my feet, but after a while it became kind of numb. But when I reached the lodging inn I felt a burning sensation in my feet.   

**Q:**  I have been to Kalimpong. What did you do in Kalimpong? There is a place called 10th mile, right?   

**A:**  There were many Tibetans.   

**Q:**  There is a place called 10th mile, right?   

**A:**  I am not quite familiar because I only stayed for 7 days, since if I stayed longer my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ]** The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> wouldn't last.   

**Q:**  How much money did you bring?   

**A:**  Six dotse. With that I bought tobacco and put it in a wooden box and carried this back. I returned to Lhasa on the 29th day of the 9th lunar month and I sold it in Lhasa.   

**Q:**  How much profit did you make?   

**A:**  The profit from this was enough to let me live okay and to have enough money to spend. I made about 4 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད]** A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> net profit from this.   

**Q:**  You were very tough and courageous for being only 18 years old? Did you buy tobacco for all the three times you went to Kalimpong?   

**A:**  Yes. Then after I finished doing the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ]** The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a>, I was about 32, and again I went to Kalimpong and this time and I brought back 4 copper water containers. I carried these on my back. Then I went also to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚོ་སྣ]** A district in southern Tibet.">Tsöna</a> on trade.   

**Q:**  How long did it take to go from Drepung to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚོ་སྣ]** A district in southern Tibet.">Tsöna</a>?   

**A:**  It took about 12 days from Drepung. It is about the same as for going to Phari [Tib. ཕག་རི].   

**Q:**  You took something to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚོ་སྣ]** A district in southern Tibet.">Tsöna</a>, right?   

**A:**  No, I just took some money.   

**Q:**  What did you buy?   

**A:**  I brought back green peppers and wooden bowls from the Buthanese. These I sold in Champaling [Tib. བྱམས་པ་གླིང] (in Lhoka).   

**Q:**  Did you have donkeys or carry things on your back?   

**A:**  I hired yaks then. There were 4 of us so we had about 15 yaks. The wooden bowls and green peppers were cheap then.   

**Q:**  What kind of a place was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚོ་སྣ]** A district in southern Tibet.">Tsöna</a>?   

**A:**  It was a poor place and the Buthanese would come up.   

**Q:**  Did they speak Tibetan? Was it easy to understand?   

**A:**  Yes, and the Buthanese also spoke Tibetan and it was easy to understand them.   

**Q:**  Was it a low altitude place where there were forests?   

**A:**  There were not many forests and not many households living there, although it was kind of well-known.   

**Q:**  Did you go with the group to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚོ་སྣ]** A district in southern Tibet.">Tsöna</a> ?   

**A:**  Yes, we went in groups of 3-4 people. We borrowed some capital and went. If we made a profit, we divided it. If we made a loss, we made it up evenly.   

**Q:**  In what month would you go there?   

**A:**  We sold the things at the Champaling Fair at the start of the 7th lunar month.   

**Q:**  Did you have to ask for leave from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས]** The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>?   

**A:**  Yes. We had to ask for leave from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས]** The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ]** Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a>, though we wouldn't tell them that we were going to Tsöna. We had to ask for leave from the chöra.   

**Q:**  How many times did you go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚོ་སྣ]** A district in southern Tibet.">Tsöna</a>?   

**A:**  I went to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚོ་སྣ]** A district in southern Tibet.">Tsöna</a> twice and also went to Metro Gongkar [Tib. མལ་གྲོ་གུང་དཀར] once to buy clay pots. These I carried back and sold in Lhasa. Then I would go again and buy more clay pots and carry them to Lhasa. And that's how I earned money. If you didn't do trade like this and just stayed in the monastery, you could manage your food and clothes. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ]** A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> don't do any trading at all, but they could still live happily. But I liked to go off trading during the summer and make some profit. I looked forward to it.

**A:**  The fire was later. About 3-4 years later.   

**Q:**  How did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས]** The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> trouble start?   

**A:**  It was something about the traja. But I was a young monk, dabedobe, so I didn't pay much attention. The leaders were on the top floor holding a meeting and we were below roaming around [Tib. འཁྲབ].   

**Q:**  What did the monk living inside do?   

**A:**  He did the nangma. His <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན]** 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag).

**Q:**  Were the two of you related to each other?   

**A:**  No.   

**Q:**  In 1959, were you in the monastery?   

**A:**  Yes. I was put in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕོ་བྲང]** Abbreviation of Ganden Phodrang, the residence of the Dalai Lama in Drepung, and later, the residence of the Tibetan government&#x27;s representative in Drepung (the Phodrang depa).">phodrang</a> and stayed as a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲལ་རིམ; ch. 阶级]** 1.

He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra.

It was considered a stepping-stone to securing higher positions and also exempted the monk from certain work obligations.">chatsül</a>, so that's why I was trerim. After 8 months they let me go. I was chabril and chatsül but I didn't exploit monks, but when they asked me, I had to say I did exploit and peeled off the people's skin. I was a trerim ngatsab. If I was in Lhasa I wouldn't have been classified as trerim. But the monastery was small, so they made me a trerim. Then during the Cultural Revolution, I made up a few rumors, so I spent 13 years in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་བཞི]** 1. An area below Sera Monastery. 2. The location of the Tibetan Armory-Mint Office and the regimental headquarters of the Khadang Regiment, which was also called the Trapchi Regiment.">Trapchi</a> Prison and the Labor Camp [Tib. ལས་མི་རུ་ཁག]. I wasn't in the revolt, but there was no way to say that. Then afterwards the government let me go. After a few months, after all my suffering, some officials came and said, your arrest was a mistake. They gave me a pass for redressing by situation and left one pass in the Department of Religious Affairs (Tib. chödön [ཆོས་དོན]) and left one in uyön lhengang [Democratic Management Committee] saying it was a mistake. After a few months, they gave me 300 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[ch. 元]** China&#x27;s basic currency unit. A yuan is divided into 100 fen and 10 jiao. It is also known as renminbi or &quot;people&#x27;s currency.&quot;">yuan</a> as something [supplement] for my livelihood. All of my things were confiscated except a little left here.   

**Q:**  What work did you do from when you were released from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕོ་བྲང]** Abbreviation of Ganden Phodrang, the residence of the Dalai Lama in Drepung, and later, the residence of the Tibetan government&#x27;s representative in Drepung (the Phodrang depa).">phodrang</a> to the Cultural Revolution?   

**A:**  I assisted blacksmith Tobgye's [Tib. སྟོབས་རྒྱས] work in the monastery, hitting the hot iron with a hammer.   

**Q:**  What wages did you get?   

**A:**  Dry Shit [Tib. སྐྱག་པ་སྐམ་པོ]! I got nothing. I swear by the Three Jewels [Tib. དཀོན་ཅོག] that for 6 month's work, they gave me 5 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[ch. 元]** China&#x27;s basic currency unit. A yuan is divided into 100 fen and 10 jiao. It is also known as renminbi or &quot;people&#x27;s currency.&quot;">yuan</a>, like giving it to a beggar . And I swear by the Buddha's Statue in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇོ་ཁང]** A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha. It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</a> [Tib. ཇོ་བོ་རིན་པོ] that I didn't have enough <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ]** The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> to eat when I had to hit that hot iron with the big hammer. They didn't pay me any work points, saying that they didn't get things from somewhere. I suffered a lot, so now I have serious pain in my knees.
